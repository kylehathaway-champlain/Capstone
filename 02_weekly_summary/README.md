# Weekly Progress Summaries

This directory contains weekly progress summaries and reflections documenting the evolution fo the Blue Team Intelligence Capstone project. These repors are a chronological record of technical work completed, challenges, faced, and scope adjustments made. They show how the project evolved from the an end-to-end SOC implementation into an intelligence driven detection design project. 

## Purpose

The weekly summaries were created to track the technical progress with planned milestones, document issues with tooling, lab stability and time constraints, capture decisons and scope evolution, and provide a transparent audit trail of project development. This history provides evidence of decisons made and adjustments to the final direction of the project. 

## Project Evolution

## 1. Early Semester (Weeks 3-5): Lab Build and Initial Vision
Early summaries focuesed on building the SOC lab environment using Security Onion, Cisco ASA, Aruba switch and Windows operating systems. They noted challeges faced with hardware and virutalization particularly around memory, networking, and log ingestion. Initial OSINT investigations were exploratory. At this stage the project was closely related to Charter v0.01, refelecting the end-to-end vision that included multiple detections, simulations Att&CK mapping, and timed incident drills.

### 2. Mid-Semester (Weeks 7-9): Friction and Re-evaluation
Mid-Semester Summaries show a recognition of limitations and the need to rescope the project. They highlight the time and skill constraints, difficulty stabilizing the SOC lab after outages and configuration drift, and increasing uncertainty around detection implementation and validation. This phase corresponds clsley with Charter v0.02 and is reinforced by the Mid-Semester Self-reflectio, which acknowledges gaps in experience, undersestimaiton of complexity and the need to rescope.

### 3. Late Semester (Weeks 11-13): Scope Reduction and Consolidation
Late Semester Summaries document even more changes. The timed drills are removed and there is a reduction to a single detection. The ATT&CK mapping is abandonded due to lack of understanding and insufficient data. The labs instability prevents reliable detection testing. THe focus shifts to organizing, documenting, and justifying wokr within GitHub.

### 5. Relationship to the Final Project
The weekly summaries do not perfectly reflect the charter. They document what was attempted, what failed or proved unreliable, why the scope was reduced and how priorities changed over time. The summaries provide context and supporting evidence for the decisions that lead to the final form of the project.
